%
In this thesis, we investigate reachable set computation for discrete nonlinear systems based on parallelotope bundles.
%
The crux of the reachability algorithm relies on computing an upper and lower bound on the supremum and infimum respectively of a nonlinear function over a rectangular domain.
%
We cover two ways of computing these bounds: one method utilizing Bernstein polynomials and the other relying on a non-linear optimization tool developed by NASA, Kodiak.
%
We aim to improve the traditional parallelotope-based reachability method by removing the manual step of parallelotope template selection in order to make the procedure fully automatic.
%
Furthermore, we show that adding templates dynamically during computations can improve accuracy.
%
% One of the simplest algorithms for computing reachable sets for discrete nonlinear systems uses parallelotope bundles and Bernstein polynomials.
%
%Our main hypothesis in this paper is that generating templates in a dynamic manner would improve the accuracy of the reachable set.
%
To this end, we investigate two techniques for generating the template directions.
%
The first technique approximates the dynamics as a linear transformation and generates templates using this linear transformation.
%
The second technique uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of sample trajectories for generating templates.
%
We have implemented our approach in a Python-based tool called Kaa.
%
%Kaa was developed as a more compact, simple implementation of the pre-existing parallelotope-based reachability tool, Sapo.
%
% have implemented two main enhancements to it.
%
The tool is modular and use two types of global optimization solvers, the first using Bernstein polynomials and the second using
the aforementioned Kodiak library.
%
We demonstrate the improved accuracy of our approach on several standard nonlinear benchmark systems, including a high-dimensional COVID19 model proposed by the Indian Supermodel Committee.
%
Finally, we explore a particular potential application of the Bernstein expansion technique to real-time reachability.
%
We present evidence of several hurdles and barriers against effectively utilizing our Bernstein coefficient pruning method.
