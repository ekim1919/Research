I would like to thank the UNC Computer Science community for supporting my work and providing me a warm community to pursue this research. In particular, I would like to thank my advisor, Parasara Sridhar Duggirala, for the opporunity to perform research and participate in his group.

%His choice to give me more autonomy to take classes at Duke University really helped me understand my academic interests better.

Bineet Ghosh, Manish Goyal, Abel Karimi, and Meghan Stuart were all great colleagues and I enjoyed my time exchanging ideas, proof-reading drafts, and socializing over group lunches. I would also like to thank Stanley Bak for helping me improve the implementation of Kaa and providing valuable feedback during this research. Juan Garcia is a wonderful collegue and an equally wonderful friend. The nights we raided Peabody and Phillips hall was certainly a memorable time. Finally, I would like to thank my parents and my family for their ardent, unending support.
